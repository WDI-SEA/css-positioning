# CSS Positioning: Instagram

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of Instagram.com.  Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

##Getting Started

The provided template contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `style.css`. In addition, you'll want to setup the BrowserSync server and CSS linters by setting up the following:

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm run lint:css` to lint your CSS
* Run `npm start` to start the BrowserSync server

##Requirements

* Use positioning selectors and the box model to position elements on the page
* Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class. Be sure to use MDN or search engines for documentation. For example:
  * `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  * `list-style`
  * `text-decoration`
  * `text-transform`
* Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
* Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  * the iPhone
  * App Store and Google Play buttons
  * Instagram Logo
  * Login button
  * Blue gradient. There's a couple different ways to do this:
    * repeat an image using `background-repeat` on `bgtile.png` (the old way)
    * use CSS3 gradients (the new way)
* Get the page as close to the deliverable as possible.
